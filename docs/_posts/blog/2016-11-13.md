Although I considered variously, I decided to rewrite GLBoost with TypeScript.
It will take some time for rewriting, so I will continue to add functionality in the current ECMAScript 2015 version GLBoost for a while.

In addition to type checking and class syntax, TypeScript 2.0 has many modern language features such as async/await and null safety.
Perhaps, using these features fully, the rewriting task should not be simple.
And although this may be a pros and cons, GLBoost's TypeScript version will discontinue support for WebGL 1.0 and support only 2.0.

There are several reasons, especially in 1.0 there are many constraints on the function of GLSL, and development is frustrated. And considering the time I can spend on the GLBoost project, by the time the TypeScript version has enough features, it can be expected that WebGL 2.0 is probably supported by all browsers. That is also a big reason ;-)

Anyway, the time I can spend is limited, but I will continue to develop GLBoost in the future.
